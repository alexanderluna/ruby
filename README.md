## Why Ruby

The main thrive for learning Ruby was Rails. Ruby and Rails go
hand in hand. Most of the programming concept I learned in
theory, started to make sense once I started to work with Ruby
and Rails. Mostly because of the near english syntax and the
OOP approach of the language from the beginning. Rails grew a lot
and matured into a good framework for building websites quick.

## My Goals with Ruby

- Rails
- Sinatra (lightweight websites)
- Nokogiri (automation/scrappers)
- Scripting (general automation)
