# Rails

> Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create
> database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
> pattern.

## Overview

1. [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup)
2. [Internationalization](#i18n)
3. [Rails CLI Commands](#rails-cli-commands)
4. [Hotwire](#hotwire)
5. [Action Cable](#action-cable)

## Installation and Setup

1. [Install Ruby](../learning_ruby) directly or using a version manager.

    ```sh
    brew install rbenv ruby-build # for mac
    sudo apt install rbenv # for linux

    rbenv init

    # list stable ruby versions
    rbenv install -l
    rbenv install 3.3.0
    ```

2. Install Rails

    ```sh
    gem install rails --no-document
    ```

3. Install extras if needed.

    ```sh
    brew install redis
    brew install postgresql

    # start services
    brew services start redis
    brew services start postgresql
    ```

4. Install and setup project

    ```bash
    git clone project.git
    cd project

    bundle install
    ```

## The Basics

Rails automatically maps the database table name `products` to the plural of
the model class `Product`. The database configuration can be found at
`config/database.yml`.

The simplest way to generate a model, view and controller is to use the
scaffold generator which also generates a **migration** file to modify the
database.

```sh
bin/rails generate scaffold Product title:string price:decimal

bin/rails db:migrate

bin/dev
```

In order to start the server, run the the `bin/dev` command this will start
multiple processes which can be found inside the `Procfile.dev`.

## I18n

Rails provides build in helper functions such which accept a locale option to
change the currency.

```ruby
number_to_currency(product.price, locale: :de)
```

For this to work you have to create a file for the locale you want to support in
`config/locales`. In this example `de.yml` and you have to specify how you want
rails to render other locales.

```yml
de:
   number:
    currency:
      format:
        delimiter: "."
        format: "%n %u"
        precision: 2
        separator: ","
        significant: false
        strip_insignificant_zeros: false
        unit: "â‚¬"
```

## Rails CLI commands

```sh
bin/dev                                 # runs Procfile.dev

bin/rails dev:cache                     # enable/disable caching

rake tailwindcss:build                  # builds tailwind styles
rake assets:precompile                  # compiles images, css, js ...
rails assets:clean                      # remove old compiled assets
```

## Hotwire

Hotwire is a collection of web frameworks which enables you to build and send
HTML fragment over the wire similar to how you would send JSON. The advantage
of sending prebuilt HTML fragments is that the browser doesn't have to do the
heavy lifting and you get instantaneous results similar to single paged apps.

- Turbo: write code in the browser to interact with our server

> Rails includes all Hotwire frameworks by default which means you won't have
> to add them manually.

## Action Cable

Since Rails 5, Rails comes with Action Cable which implements websocket and
allows you to broadcast and receive messages.

1. Create a channel

    ```sh
    bin/rails generate channel ENTITY
    ```

2. Create a stream in your channel. For simplicity the entity and channel name
should be the same.

    ```ruby
    class ENTITYChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
      def subscribed
        stream_from "entity_channel"
      end
    end
    ```

3. Broadcast the HTML

    ```ruby
    def update
      ...
      @entity.broadcast_replace_later_to 'entity_channel', partial: 'template'
    end
    ```

4. Receive the HTML broadcasted

    ```erb
    <%= turbo_stream_from 'entity_channel' %>
    <%= turbo_frame_tag(dom_id(ENTITY)) do %>
    # display your entity
    <% end %>
    ```
